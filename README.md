The Standards
===

The Standards is a WordPress theme that is based on the U.S. Web Design Standards (https://standards.usa.gov/). While it is minimal, it does provide some elements right out of the box that can be used or removed. The idea is for developers to create additional custom functionality in their own version of this theme, while utilizing or modifying what is already provided. Here is what's included:

* Well commented WordPress page templates
* Numerous widgets (top widget, header right widget, above footer widget, 3 footer widgets, and a bottom footer widget)
* Toggled mobile navigation
* Mobile friendly sub-navigation
* Custom logo option
* Customizer options for header, navigation, body, and footer background colors as well as options for header and background images
* The U.S. Web Design Standards
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later

The next step is to create a custom WordPress theme of your own, utilizing the U.S. Web Design Standards.

Enjoy!
